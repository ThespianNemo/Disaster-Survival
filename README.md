In each 'disaster', the user will be presented with a question that they will have to answer correctly in order to escape. If they answer incorrectly, they will be given a new question. If the quetion is answered incorrectly, they will be given ONE FINAL QUESTION. If all 3 questions are answered incorrectly, THEY'LL BE TAKING A DIRT NAP!!!
